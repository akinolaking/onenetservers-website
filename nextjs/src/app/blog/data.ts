Your domain name is your address on the internet. It is what people type, what appears on business cards, and what shows up in Google search results. Choosing the wrong one costs you credibility before anyone even sees your website.

## Keep it short and memorable

Aim for two or three words at most. Long domain names are hard to type, easy to misremember, and difficult to share verbally. If your business is called "Adewale Fresh Farms Nigeria Limited", your domain should not be adewalesfreshfarmsnigeria.com. Try adewale.farm, adewale.ng, or freshfarms.ng instead.

The rule: if you cannot say it over the phone without spelling it out, it is too long.

## Choose the right extension for your audience

For Nigerian businesses, the choice of domain extension carries meaning:

- **.ng** — Nigeria's official country code. Short, clear, and signals local authority. Best for Nigerian-first brands.
- **.com.ng** — The most trusted Nigerian extension. Used by banks, telecoms, and established businesses. Great for SMEs.
- **.name.ng** — Built for personal brands, portfolios, and solo creators. The most affordable Nigerian extension.
- **.com** — Still the global default. Use it if your audience is international or if you intend to operate globally.

OneNet Servers is a NiRA-accredited registrar, which means we can register .ng, .com.ng, and .name.ng domains directly — no third-party delays, no markup, faster activation.

## Avoid hyphens, numbers, and abbreviations

Hyphens (fresh-farms.ng) create confusion when shared verbally. Numbers (fresh4farms.ng) do the same. Abbreviations only work if your brand is already famous — and if you are reading this, it probably is not yet.

## Check social media handles at the same time

Before you register, confirm the same name is available on Instagram, X, and LinkedIn. You want @yourname on every platform to match your domain. If it is taken on socials, consider a variant now rather than re-branding later.

## Register your domain for at least two years

A brand-new domain registered for one year can signal instability to Google's crawlers. Register for two or more years. It is a small cost, and it tells search engines you are committed.

## What to do right now

Search your preferred name using the domain finder on the OneNet Servers homepage. The tool checks availability across .ng, .com.ng, .com, and more in real time. If your first choice is taken, we suggest close alternatives automatically.

If you qualify as a founder, student, freelancer, or creator, check the [Digital Identity Initiative](/digital-identity) — your first year of domain, hosting, and email is free.

Most Nigerian founders, students, and freelancers do not have a professional website. Not because they lack the skills or the idea, but because the upfront cost — domain, hosting, email, SSL — feels like a barrier when there are more urgent things to spend money on.

The Digital Identity Initiative (DII) removes that barrier completely for year one.

## What is included in the DII

Every approved applicant receives the following at no cost for the first 12 months:

**A free domain name**
Choose from .name.ng, .com.ng, or .ng — the extensions that establish a clearly Nigerian digital identity. Your domain is registered in your name and is yours to keep even if you do not renew with us.

**Free shared web hosting**
LiteSpeed web server with CloudLinux container isolation, free SSL certificate, and enough resources to run a professional website, blog, or portfolio. The same infrastructure that powers our paid plans — not a stripped-down trial.

**Free business email (up to 5 addresses)**
Your own @yourdomain.ng email addresses. No @gmail in your business communications from day one.

**AI website builder access**
Generate your full website from a text prompt. Our builder produces templates for any industry — services, portfolio, e-commerce, events. No design skills required.

## Who qualifies

The DII is open to:

- **Founders and entrepreneurs** whose businesses are registered for less than 24 months and operating from Nigeria
- **Students and recent graduates** building a professional presence
- **Freelancers and independent creators** who need an online home for their work
- **Community organisations** — registered non-profits, clubs, and community groups with a Nigerian presence

We do not require proof of revenue, registration papers, or guarantees of any kind. The application is a short form. Most qualifying applicants are approved within 2 business days.

## What happens after year one

We send a renewal notice 30 days before any charge. You choose to continue at our standard rates (from $3.99/mo for hosting, standard domain prices) or let the services lapse. There is no obligation, no auto-charge without notice, and no credit card required during the free period.

## How to apply

Go to [onenetservers.net/digital-identity](/digital-identity) and complete the short application form. Name, email, category, and a brief description of what you will use the website for. That is all.

Applications are reviewed by our Lagos-based team. We will email you within 2 business days.

When people buy shared hosting, they compare storage, bandwidth, and price. Almost nobody asks what web server software runs underneath. That is a mistake, because the server software determines how fast your site loads more than almost anything else — including which plan you are on.

## What a web server actually does

Every time someone opens your website, a request travels from their browser to your server. The server software receives that request, processes it, and sends back the page. How efficiently it does this under load — with hundreds or thousands of simultaneous visitors — is the difference between a 0.8-second load time and a 4-second load time.

Apache has been the standard for decades. It works. But it was designed in a time when websites were mostly static HTML files, and when simultaneous traffic meant tens of requests, not thousands.

## What LiteSpeed does differently

LiteSpeed is an event-driven server. Instead of spawning a new process for every incoming request (Apache's model), it handles many connections in a single thread. The practical result: LiteSpeed uses dramatically less RAM and CPU under the same traffic load.

**LiteSpeed-specific features that matter:**

- **LSCache** — a full-page cache built into the server. For WordPress sites, LSCache is the fastest caching layer available, faster than WP Super Cache or W3 Total Cache because it operates below the PHP layer.
- **HTTP/3 and QUIC support** — the latest transport protocols, which reduce latency especially on mobile networks. Apache does not natively support HTTP/3.
- **Built-in rate limiting and DDoS mitigation** — LiteSpeed can absorb and reject malicious traffic at the server layer, before it consumes PHP or database resources.
- **Drop-in Apache compatibility** — .htaccess files work without modification. Migrating from Apache-based hosting to LiteSpeed requires no changes to your application.

## What this means for a typical WordPress site

In independent benchmarks, a WordPress site on LiteSpeed with LSCache enabled handles around 3× more requests per second than the same site on Apache. Under normal shared hosting conditions, this translates to load times consistently under 1 second versus 2–4 seconds on a congested Apache server.

Page speed affects more than user experience. Google's Core Web Vitals directly factor load time into search rankings. A faster server means better SEO, fewer bounces, and higher conversion on landing pages.

## Every OneNet Servers plan runs LiteSpeed

We made the decision to standardise on LiteSpeed Enterprise across all shared, reseller, and WordPress hosting plans. Not as an upsell, not as a premium tier — as the baseline.

CloudLinux adds container isolation on top: each account gets its own memory and CPU limits so a busy neighbour cannot slow your site down. It is the same isolation model that enterprise hosting providers use, applied to shared plans from $3.99/mo.

If you are currently on an Apache-based host and your Pagespeed score is below 80, server software is likely a factor. [Migrate to OneNet Servers free](/hosting/web) — we handle the transfer at no cost on every plan.
